# Overview

You are building a **high-contrast, SEO-first, opinionated web product** focused on **head-to-head fragrance comparison and rankings**.

This product is **NOT**:

* a review site
* an e-commerce site
* a social network
* a dashboard
* a generic SaaS app

It is a **taste arena**.

---

## CORE PRODUCT LOOP

Users repeatedly:

1. See two fragrances in a head-to-head matchup
2. Choose the winner instantly
3. Receive brief feedback (upset, alignment, rank movement)
4. Immediately see the next matchup

Speed, clarity, and momentum are critical.

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

* Dark background
* Minimal UI
* Large visuals
* Bold typography
* Zero clutter
* No unnecessary animations
* No generic SaaS components

The UI should feel:

* decisive
* confident
* slightly confrontational
* premium but restrained

Avoid:

* decorative gradients
* busy layouts
* playful or whimsical UI

---

## PAGE INVENTORY (DO NOT ADD MORE)

Build **only** the following pages:

* `/` — Arena voting page
* `/rankings` — Fragrance rankings by category
* `/fragrance/[slug]` — Lightweight fragrance detail page
* `/about` — Philosophy / explanation
* `/privacy` — Privacy policy

Do not create additional pages unless explicitly requested.

---

## ARENAS (CONTEXTUAL, NOT ABSOLUTE)

The following arenas exist:

* Overall
* Masculine-leaning
* Feminine-leaning
* Unisex

Arenas define **voting context**, not permanent classification.

A fragrance may exist in multiple arenas.

---

## MATCHMAKING & RANKING LOGIC

* Use an **Elo-based ranking system**
* Maintain separate Elo per arena
* Rankings are derived from Elo, not raw votes
* Elo values are hidden from users

Matchmaking rules:

* Prefer similar-ranked fragrances
* Occasionally force upsets
* Avoid repeating matchups in short windows

---

## POST-VOTE FEEDBACK (REQUIRED)

After each vote, show 1–2 brief feedback messages:

* “You agreed with X% of voters”
* “Upset win”
* “This fragrance moved up/down”
* “Winning streak / losing streak”

Feedback should auto-dismiss and load the next matchup without friction.

---

## SEO REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)

This is an **SEO-driven product**.

* Every page must have a unique, descriptive `<title>`
* Every page must have a single clear `<h1>`
* Rankings pages must be crawlable and server-rendered
* Fragrance detail pages must be indexable
* Use clean, human-readable URLs
* Avoid JS-only rendering for critical content
* Do not hide rankings behind client-only state

---

## DATA MODEL EXPECTATIONS

Minimum required data entities:

* Fragrances
* Battles
* Votes
* Derived rankings

No user accounts in MVP.
Use anonymous sessions with rate limiting.

---

## EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN FEATURES

Do **NOT** add:

* user accounts or authentication
* comments or reviews
* star ratings
* shopping or affiliate links
* accord charts
* note breakdowns
* recommendation engines
* AI-generated explanations
* social sharing popups
* onboarding flows

If a feature is not explicitly required, do not add it.

---

## INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS

* Voting must feel instant
* No confirmation modals
* No page refresh after voting
* Next matchup loads automatically
* Users should be able to vote 20+ times per session without friction

---

## PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINTS

* Optimize for speed and responsiveness
* Avoid heavy animation libraries
* Prefer CSS transitions
* Optimize and lazy-load images
* Prioritize Lighthouse performance over visual flair

---

## ERROR & EDGE CASE HANDLING

* If insufficient data exists, still show rankings
* If images fail, degrade gracefully
* Never block the user from voting due to minor errors

---

## PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY (IMPORTANT)

This product **does not claim objectivity**.

It ranks:

* collective taste
* memory
* cultural impact

Disagreement is expected and desired.

---

## BUILD WITH EXTENSIBILITY IN MIND

Future features (out of scope for now) may include:

* new arenas
* blind voting
* tournaments

Do not prematurely optimize or build these now.

---

**If there is ever ambiguity, prioritize:**

1. Simplicity
2. Clarity
3. SEO
4. Speed
5. Momentum
